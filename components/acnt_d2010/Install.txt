Install of 32bit packages for Delphi:

1. Start by unpacking the acnt*.zip files into a folder of your own choice.

1. Install 32bit package in the IDE.
2. Configure an application options, define a path to 64bit units for "Win64 platform" configuration.
32bit units should be used in design-time, 64bit units should be used in run-time 
for an application building for Win64 platform.
